### Wikidata SPARQL for non-person entity typing

Investigate Wikidata as a type validator for entities where notability is expected.

**Status:** Open — investigation, not committed work.
**Priority:** P3
**Source:** gap-2 web research session, 2026-07-13

Wikidata was rejected for *person* validation because personal documents are dominated by non-notable people it can never confirm. But the notability profile inverts for other entity types the system already detects, where a large share of true positives *are* notable:

- **Organizations** — validate `entity_detector.extract_company_names` output (vendors, employers) against organization classes before creating `Organization/{Name}/` folders.
- **Research publishers** — confirm publisher identity for `Research/{Publisher}/` routing (`schema_type=ScholarlyArticle`).
- **Locations** — type-check detected place names before creating Location nodes.
- **Events** — a positive event-class match is a strong *negative* signal for person/org detection (would have caught `Morning Train` if notable).

Technical notes from the research: `P31` (instance-of) checks against class QIDs (org `Q43229`+subclasses, event `Q1656682`/`Q52943`, human `Q5`); content is CC0 so results cache in SQLite indefinitely; rate limits ~5 parallel queries/IP + 60s query-time/min + mandatory identifiable User-Agent (nightly sequential batch fits easily); the ready-made reconciliation endpoint `wikidata.reconci.link` (W3C Reconciliation API v0.2, `query + type hint → ranked scored candidates`) is the lower-effort integration path vs raw SPARQL. Investigation should size: hit rate on the real `companies` table, wrong-entity collision risk, and whether a "no match" fallback stays cheap. Keep any implementation as an optional nightly enrichment — the core pipeline must remain offline-capable.

### `PHOTO_PROPERTY_CONFIDENCE` re-tune for `Media/Interiors` commit margin

`PhotoCompositionSignal`'s home-interior flag routes to `media/interiors_other` (folder `Media/Interiors`, schema.org `Room`) but scores `PHOTO_PROPERTY_CONFIDENCE(0.7) × W_PEOPLE_PHOTO(0.65) = 0.455` — only 0.055 over an image's `mime_fallback` vote (`0.4`). That lead is below `MIN_DECISION_MARGIN(0.10)`, so an interior photo whose only signals are composition + mime routes to `LOW_CONFIDENCE_FALLBACK` instead of committing to `Media/Interiors`. The `Room` schema override is wired but effectively unreachable for the common two-signal case.

**Status:** Open — not committed work; calibration change with eval impact.
**Priority:** P3
**Source:** `Media/Interiors` / schema.org `Room` folder addition, 2026-07-17

- **Do not eyeball the bump.** Per the Phase-3 calibration process (`src/scoring/weights.py` header — "treat this module as versioned data and commit each re-tune with its backtest report"), any change to `PHOTO_PROPERTY_CONFIDENCE` (or `W_PEOPLE_PHOTO`) must be backed by a `results/file_organization.db` backtest, committed with the report.
- **Target invariant:** `PHOTO_PROPERTY_CONFIDENCE × W_PEOPLE_PHOTO − (MIME_MATCH_CONFIDENCE × W_MIME) ≥ MIN_DECISION_MARGIN`, i.e. `conf ≥ (0.4 + 0.10) / 0.65 ≈ 0.77`, so interiors commit over the mime-only floor.
- **Regression guard:** measure false positives — staged/real-estate listing photos and any non-interior images the analyzer flags `is_property_mgmt` — before raising, since a higher confidence also strengthens every interior vote against genuine content winners.
- **Legacy parity note:** the legacy `_classify_photo_composition` still routes interiors to `property_management/other`; a unified re-tune widens the shadow legacy-vs-unified disagreement for interior photos until the legacy chain is retired (Phase 5).

### Content pipeline is OCR-bound (gate OCR on text-likelihood)

Profiling `organize-files content` (unified scorer, dry-run) on 2026-07-17 showed the workflow is **~85% OCR-bound** (`torch.conv2d` in the easyocr CRAFT + docTR detection CNNs ≈ 67% of self-time; CLIP is negligible). This session shipped P2/P3/P5 (docTR-fallback gate, screenshot double-OCR dedup, CLIP text-embedding memoization) — conv2d call count dropped 1189→528 (−56%). Two items remain.

**Status:** Open — P1 shipped 2026-07-18 (gate on by default); P2 gate shipped (recall tradeoff to monitor).
**Priority:** P3
**Source:** content-classification profiling + P2/P3/P5 optimization session, 2026-07-17

1. **Gate OCR on text-likelihood (P1) — Done.** `OCR_CLIP_GATE_TOPK = 3` constant added to `src/scoring/weights.py`; gate enabled by default in `ContentOrganizer` and `ContentBasedFileOrganizer` (was opt-in only). `FileContext._skip_ocr_by_clip_gate` now also treats `K=0` as disabled so users can opt out with `--ocr-clip-topk 0`. Eval: K=3 → 100% text recall, ~35% of photos skip OCR. Gate fails open when CLIP is unavailable. 15 unit tests added to `tests/unit/scoring/test_context.py::TestClipOcrGate`.

2. **P2 docTR-fallback gate — recall tradeoff to monitor.** The shipped gate (`extract_ocr_with_confidence`: skip the docTR fallback when easyocr cleanly finds no text) was eval'd over 7 text images at varying difficulty: **1/7 recall loss — very-low-contrast text** (easyocr's detector found nothing; docTR would have caught it). Clean, dark-mode, and rotated text were all gate-safe. So P2 trades a rare miss on near-invisible text for eliminating the docTR fallback. For a screenshot/photo-dominated 265k-file library this is very likely a net win, but it is a real behavior change — put it behind a config flag or revert if faint-text recall matters.


### Content organizer misclassifies diverse/screenshot sources (review-gate + robustness gaps)

A live `organize-files content --source ~/Desktop --limit 10` (unified scorer) on mixed real-world desktop content committed most files to wrong folders and surfaced several distinct gaps. Items 2–5 shipped; item 1 remains open.

**Status:** Open — item 1 gates safe use on real user directories.
**Priority:** P2 (item 1)
**Source:** `~/Desktop` content-run audit + full rollback, 2026-07-17

1. **The review gate keys on decision-confidence, which `InteriorSignal` inflates.** UI screenshots of real-estate listings committed to `Media/Interiors` (`Room`) because the interior probe votes ~0.99 (decision confidence ~0.85, margin ~0.81) even when the OCR/label confidence is 1–12%. The `low_confidence`/`low_margin` review bucket exists and *does* fire (confirmed in a `--scorer shadow` pass — one opaque PDF routed to `uncategorized/other`), but cannot catch these because the probe supplies genuine high decision-confidence to wrong content. Options: a per-signal reliability cap, or require corroboration for `InteriorSignal` on screenshot-detected inputs. Distinct from the `PHOTO_PROPERTY_CONFIDENCE` item above (that is the `PhotoCompositionSignal` property flag *under*-committing; this is the `InteriorSignal` probe *over*-committing). The scene-model swap in [`docs/plans/MEDIA_EXTERIORS_PLAN.md`](plans/MEDIA_EXTERIORS_PLAN.md) also intersects here.
